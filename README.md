# Korduene
Korduene is a visual programming IDE.
I initially wrote it in my spare time using WinForms & WPF.
However that had quite a few issues, so I decided to rewrite the whole thing.
What you see here is the attempt of that rewrite at its early stages.
Most of the code is "just make it work" and/or experiments and needs some serious work.
Long story short, here is the source.

## Getting Started
You need to clone the repository and build it.

### Prerequisites
* Visual Studio 2019
* .NET 5 SDK

### Running Korduene
Build the solution and copy "C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\5.0^" to "Korduene\bin\Debug\net5.0".
This is necessary because it cannot resolve the SDK at the moment and I don't have a working solution for this.
